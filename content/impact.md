Statistics and OpenData enable network effects, data reuse, and collaborative revision of our project. But they are tricky and can't be released carelessly:

* [Data can't be anonymized](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/23/anonymised-data-never-be-anonymous-enough-study-finds) easily, we aggregate them and we use only non-personal metadata to develop the aggregation.
* We don't want to help in any way [social media intelligence](https://responsibledata.io/social-media-intelligence-the-wayward-child-of-open-source-intelligence/).
* Is in our DNA [enable researchers](/data-activism), we described which are our [data usage policies](/what-we-collect).
* The public stats below display how the system is performing how the people use it (no content-related analysis are here).
