# Criteria

Our primary goal, in the first test, is to see how much the personalized experience changes between people doing the same access.

For each of the points above we've a reason to ask you to do this:

* Homepage change often during the 24 hours and there is a nationalization such as (hot videos in '*Your Country*'), steps 1 and 6 are mean to check this
* The recommended videos change by the activity performed: we want to see how fast they change, and in point 4 and 6, if they change equally around the globe
* The related video of an old video don't change, is that true around the world? (step 3)
* The related video of a freshly published video will change more frequently, can we trace something? (step 5)

Our goal is not yet investigating on the *reasons* of PornHub to do this, but rather, measure some basic variations and test our process.

# Timeline

* 05 January 2020: we made our tests #0
* 08 January 2020: soft annoucement, production of posts, repetition of sequences
