# Criteria

Our primary goal, in the first test, is to see how much the personalized experience changes between people performing the same actions.

All steps in the test have a motivation behind it:

* The homepage changes frequently over 24 hours, and the changes are partly location-specific ("hot videos in '*Your Country*'"); steps 1 and 6 are meant to check this
* The recommended videos change by the activity performed: how fast do they change, and (steps 4 and 6) do they change equally around the world?
* Old videos will have a stable list of related videos: is that true around the world? (step 3)
* Freshly published videos will have a list of related videos that changes more frequently: can we quantify how much? (step 5)

Our goal is not to investigate *why* PornHub does what they do, yet, but rather, to take some basic measurements and test our process.
